## So you wanna be a wizard

There's probably someone you work with who's the person you go to when you really hork your git repo.

"Please," you cry. "I did something wrong in the middle of a rebase and now my changes are GONE!  Can you unhork me, o
great wizard ðŸ¥¹?"

The wizard glances at your screen, a crease furrows their brow, and they begin arcane incantations.  "REFLOG!" they
cry.  "RESET!" they command.  Dashes appear and flags rain down in the terminal.

They sit back, a satisfied smile on their face, dusting their hands.  "There you go."  Your week of work is saved!  The
wizard smiles "Your changes were never gone, you know, they were always right here."  You thank them profusely and they walk
away.  You know the truth, though: your work was deleted, and the wizard translocated it from some arcane dimension.

As you resume your feature, you daydream about gaining such mastery over the forces of the repo.

## The mysteries

I will now induct you into the mysteries of git.  Here you go:

* A branch is just a pointer to a commit
* Nothing committed to a git repo ever goes away[^1]

[^1]: Ok this isn't strictly true.  But it's true enough most of the time.
