## All the writing on this blog is mine.

I write this blog because I enjoy writing and I'd like people to read what I've written[^1]. I'll use LLMs to grammar
and spell check, although I find they rarely do a better job than just re-reading what I've written.

[^1]: Ok, and because I enjoy the dopamine hit of watching the hit-counter go up, I'm human.  Kinda the point, no?

I think I'm a reasonably good writer.  I'm not against LLMs writing for me per se, but as of now they write badly and with lots of cliches, and I *am* against bad writing.

## The illustrations on this blog are AI-generated

I think I'm a reasonably lousy visual artist.  I don't make any money off this blog. If I didn't image-gen some
illustrations I wouldn't pay anyone to draw them for me, so there just wouldn't be any.  A good image or visual pun can
punch up an article: I think the [Shelf of Despair in this post](https://www.emoses.org/posts/moving-my-pi-to-an-ssd/)
is pretty funny, and I prompted Nano Banana for a while to get it how I liked it.

## I use LLMs as tools to help me write code

I'll use them for what they're good for. That's changing weekly, but at the time of this writing in early 2026:

* They're excellent at generating boilerplate with my codebase or doc for reference.
* They're pretty good at mechanical refactoring
* They can code up a good starting point for unit test cases
* They're perfect for getting started on a greenfield app in common languages and frameworks

In general, if the thing I'm trying to do would involve me googling doc or Stack Overflow answers and 90% of the result
would be copy/paste from what I looked up, an LLM can do it significantly faster than I could.

I treat a coding agent like an inexperienced but sharp junior dev, but one that doesn't learn day-to-day. You can give
it a well-defined task and it'll give you a pretty good result, but if you ask too much of it without looking over its
shoulder you'll end up with a real mess.

I generally review all its generated code as if I was reviewing a PR, and I'll rewrite it or pick-and-choose from its
results as I see fit.

## When I use AI for anything non-trivial I will credit it.

Simple, easy, honest.
