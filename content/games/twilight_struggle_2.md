Unfortunately, A.C. and I didn't have a chance to get together again before I had to clean up the games table, so there is no conclusion for our Twilight Struggle game.  However, unbeknownst to him, I had the Middle East Scoring Card in hand, and was only one or two influence points away from having Control of the region.  If I had manged to score while I had control, or if I had managed to Dominate and gotten one more Battleground country, I would have won the game.  So it's probably a good thing that A.C. didn't have to come over just to play two more action rounds.
