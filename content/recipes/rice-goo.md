# Rice Goo (Thick Chicken & Rice Soup)

*Serves 4, 35min*

A very thick chicken and rice soup, but not cooked until the rice breaks down like congee.  This is perfect for "you're
sick, have some soup".  Also infinitely variable: sub vegetables, change the seasoning, squeeze in a little lemon;
leave out the chicken, add more chicken.  If you're in a hurry you can skip toasting the rice or even saut√©ing the
vegetables.  This is one point on an infinite manifold of chicken soup recipes.

If you put this in the fridge, the rice will continue to absorb liquid and get thicker.  You may need to add a little
stock or water when you reheat it.

## Ingredients

* 5 C chicken stock (see [On Stock](#stock) below)
* 1 C long-grain rice, like jasmine
* 2tsp olive oil
* 1 1/2 carrots (1 small, 1 large, or estimate), diced
* 1 stalk celery, diced
* 1 scallion, white and green parts, diced fine
* 1/4 tsp Guajillo chile (see [On Chile](#chile) below)
* 1 breast or 2 thighs chicken, diced (raw or leftovers)
* Salt & pepper to taste

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high.  Add carrot and celery, season, and cook until softened, 2-3min.
Add scallion and cook until wilted, another minute or two.  Add rice and cook 3-4 minutes until slightly toasted.  Add
stock and bring to a boil.

Lower heat to medium-low, keeping the soup at a very low simmer, partially cover, and cook for 16 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Add the chicken.  If it's pre-cooked, cook 2-3 minutes until warmed through.  If raw, cook 6-7 minutes until cooked
through.

### On stock {#stock}

Like every cookbook author, I'm gonna tell you that homemade stock is the best, because it *really* is.  Make some
stock if you can (I keep it in the freezer).  If you don't have any, your next-best bet is "enhanced" store-bought stock:
boil the stock with some veggies (carrot, onion, celery, etc.) or veggie scraps for 20-30 min and strain it.  It's
shocking how much better it is.  Better than Bullion is, well, better than bullion, and it's honestly better than a lot
of the stocks you'll buy at the store.

### On Chile {#chile}

This is not strictly necessary, but I think it adds a nice little bit of flavor. You can use basically any powdered
chile you like, of any heat, including sweet or hot paprika, cayenne, or whatever you've got around.  This is *not*
chili powder, though, which has cumin and other spices.
